- [Clarity] Modal with script cannot be x'ed out and copy is unclear about what to do after I deploy the script. We could add empty state text in the modal along the lines of "We haven't received any signups yetâ€”this box will disappear when you receive your first signup. Need help? (helpful link)"
- [Bug] Script failure: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getAttribute' of null`. This happens because we are looking for a `data-debug` attribute; this should be removed in our production script, otherwise the script does NOT work.
- [Bug?] Not seeing any calls to signupsumo on blur or submit.
